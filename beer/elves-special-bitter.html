      <p class="description">
        This beer is an alternate version to an ESB that I brew a lot. This
        time, the base recipe is Timothy Taylors Landlords, but with the grain
        bill bulked up while keeping the same percentages. F&J caragold has also
        been added, and this was mashed at a higher temperature to give a fuller
        body and sweeter finish.</br></br>
        The hops are Styrian Goldings and EKG, with an extra batch added at flamout. The yeast is a mix of WHC English Old Ale and Nottingham.</br></br>
        Please return the bottle to the brewer.
