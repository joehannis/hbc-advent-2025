    <p class="description">
      For the 2024 HBC advent calendar I have brewed an export stout based on
      the beer brewed by legendary brewery The Kernel. The base beer was split
      in half, each of which were spiked with a tincture.</br></br> This version mixes the
      stout with a coffee and rum tincture. More information about the
      inspiration behind the original beer is given <a class='ian-link' href="https://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2010/01/lets-brew-wednesday-1890-truman-export.html">here</a>
