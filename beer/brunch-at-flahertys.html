        Brew club members who participated last year will remember my 'Breakfast
        at Flaherty's' Irish coffee stout. That stout has now been aged for 15
        months, and as it has aged, the whiskey flavour has taken over. My new
        imperial stout takes this 15 month old, whiskey barrel aged impy, and
        blends it with a new batch of Japanese coffee imperial stout. </br></br>This new
        imperial stout is around 3 months old, and was dry beaned on Ueshima coffee from
        Japan for 36 hours.</br></br> Please return the bottle to the brewer.
