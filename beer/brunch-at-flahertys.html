        Brew club members who participated last year will remember my 'Breakfast
        at Flaherty's' Irish coffee stout. That stout has now been aged for 2 years, and as it has aged, the whiskey flavour has taken over. My new
        imperial stout takes this 2 year old, whiskey barrel aged coffee impy, and
        blends it with a new batch of young, sweeter imperial stout.</br></br>
        Please return the bottle to the brewer.
