      Both my Advent Calendar beers were brewed with friends.</br></br> This 6-hop IPA was
      brewed with my American friend Samantha, with 6 different American hops -
      Amarillo, Chinook, Simcoe, Citra, Nugget & Galaxy, with 5 mixed hop
      additions in the boil & then dry-hopped. Malts include Vienna & caramel,
      and yeast was US05
