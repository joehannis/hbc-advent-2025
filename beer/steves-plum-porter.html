    <p class="description">
      Both my Advent Calendar beers were brewed with friends.</br></br> This plum porter
      was brewed with my friend Steve, and is supposed to be a clone of the
      famous Titanic one (not that I've ever tried that). The beer includes plums
      from his allotment, and Admiral & Bramling Cross hops. Base was Maris
      Otter with various specialty malts to add flavour & colour, and yeast was
      S04.
