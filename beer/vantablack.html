    <p class="description">
      Brewed in July 2024 and continuing to mellow this full bodied imperial
      stout is perfect for a cold winters evening. </br></br>Aged on Plantation Rum barrel
      chips, this dark, rich beer adds notes of chocolate and rum along with
      dried fruits with a rich sweetness to balance it. This beer will continue
      to improve with age. </br></br>Best served in a snifter at 15c.
